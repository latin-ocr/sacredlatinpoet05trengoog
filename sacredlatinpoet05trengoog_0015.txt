X PREFAOE.

because, grauting a collection made upon these
principles to be desirable, it appears to me that it
has not yet been made; that those which we pos-
sess still leave room for such a one as the present.

What need is there, for example, that the Veni,
Redemptor Gentium, or the Dies Iroe, or any other
of these immortal heritages of the universal Church,
should be presented to us as part or parcel of the
Romanor any other breviary? They were not
written for these; their findhrg a place in these is
their accident and not their essence. Why then
should they be offered, as coming through chan-
nels and with associatione linked to them, which
can scarcely fail to make them distasteful to many?
Not to say that while pieces of sacred Lathr verse
drawn from such obvious sources have been pub-
lished again and again-and not only the good,
but very osten with it much also of very slightest
worth-other noblest compositione, whether con-
templated as works of art, or from a more solemn
point of view, have been left unregarded and ap-
parently unknown. If I may conclude, in regard
of others, from a few friends to whom l have sub-
mitted portione of this volume, as it was gotten
together, most of my readers will aoknowledge
that they here have met something which was new
to them, yet with which they were glad to be ¹
made acquainted.
