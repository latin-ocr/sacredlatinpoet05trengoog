Surely with all 110 rudeness end deficiencies this
poem has the true passion 01 nature, and contains in it
the prophecy 01 much more than it actually accom-
plishes. In that

,Gloriosa valde factu veris prae laetitit,
we have no wcak preludes 01 such rapturous enthusiasm

and inspiration in like kind, as at a later day have given
