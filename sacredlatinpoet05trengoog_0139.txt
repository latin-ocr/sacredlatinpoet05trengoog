Fertintase potens, o dulce et nobile lignum,
Quando tuis ramis tarn nova poma geris. 10
Cujus odoro novo defuncta cadavera surgunt,
Et redeunt vitae qui caruero die.
Nullum urci aestus suh frondibus arboris hujus,
Luna nec in nocie, sol neque meridie.
Tu plantata micas, secus esi ubi cursus aquarum, 15
Spargis οι ornatas flore recente comos.
Appcnsa ost vitis inter tua brachia, do qud
Dulcia sanguineo vina rubore fluunt.

1³, 1⁴. cf. Ps. cxx. 6.

lo. rectu] The use oi occasa as a proposition governing an
accusative, (here understand loca) and aa equivalent ιο secundom,
though unknown to classical Latinity, belongs alike ιο the anterior
and the subsequent period of the language, to Cato and to Pliny.
And thus wa have Ps. i. 3. (Vulg.) words, which doubtless were in
tho poet's mind when he wrote this line: Et erit tanquam lignum,
quod plantatum est secus decursus aquarum, quod fructum suurn
dabit in tempore suo.

17. uitia] The crosa as the tree ιο which the vine is clinging,
and from which its condrils and fruit depend, is a beautiful wear-
ing in of the image of the true Vine with the fact oi the crucifixion.
The blending of one image and another eomes perhaps yet more
beautifully out, though not with quite such logical coherente, in
that which sometimes appears iu ancient works oi Christian art,-
namely, Christ set forth as the hamb round which the branchos oi

a loaded vine are clustering and clinging.
