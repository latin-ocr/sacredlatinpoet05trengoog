age. Itis rather, like poeuy, like musio, the natural
result ofa deep eraving of the human mind: as it is
the almost inevitable adjunct of a poetry not quan-
titative, and almost certainly developing itself there.
This last point has been well expressed, and the causes
of it rightly stated by a writer but just now quoted¹.
He says: “When the same modification of eound re-
cnrs at definite intervals, the coincidence very readily

a strikes the ear, aud when it is found in aooented syl-

than if they merely received the aocent. Hence we
may perceive the importanee ol rhyme in accentual
verse. It ie not, as it is sometimes asserted, a mere
ornament: it marks and defines the accent, and thereby
strengthens and supporta the rhythm. Its advantages
have been felt so strongly, that no people have ever
adopted an accentnal rhythm‚ without also adopting
rhyrne.” In this its universality, in the lact, too, that it is
peculiar neither to the early rudeness of a barbarous age,
nor to the over-refined ingenuity of alate and artificial
one, bnt runs through whole literatures from their
beginning to their end we find its best defenoe3-or,
indeed, that rather which exempts it from needing any
