, it professed to be, and thus indeed should be, the ex-

pression. A struggle therefore commenced from the first,
between the form and spirit-between the old heathen
form and the new Christian spirit-the latter secking
to release itself from the shackles and restraints which

the former imposed upon it, and which were to it, not -

a help auda support, as the form ought to be, buta
hindrance and a weakuess-not liberty, but now rather
a most galling bondage1. The new wine went on fer-

effectually at work, the disintegration ol the old prosodia system
already beginning. He still affecta to write, and iu the main does
write, prosodicallyt yet with largest licentes. Now it is not ior a
moment to be supposed that he was more ignorantthau most school-
boys of fourteen would he now, oi the quantitative value which the
old classical poete of Italy, with whose writings he was evidently
familiar, had attributed to words‘; yet we conunually find him
attributing another, postponiug quantity to accent, or rather allow-
ing accent to determine quantity, as cyaneus, Sardinia, enigma.
As his latest editor has observed: Metrum haud rarb negligitur,
quia poeta in arsi vv. majorem vim accentui quim quantitati tri-
buit. (otharii Prudentius, p. lt.) The whole scheme of Latin
prosody must have greatly loosened and let go its hold, before he
could have used the freedom which he does use, in the rhit'ting and
altering the value oi syllables. We marli iu him especially a de-
termination not to be deprived altogether of the use of words
through a metrical notation which excluded them ia toto irem a

good, where the word is really required by him. 'l'hus he writes =
temulentus, delibutus, iddiolarrix, calcetmentum, margaritum:
though aa regards this last word, in an iambic verse, where there
was no motive, but the contrary, for producing the antepenultima,
he restores to that syllable its true quantity, and writes margarita.
In the same way it was not ignorante nor caprice, but the feeling
that they murthave the word ecclesia at command, while yet, is
