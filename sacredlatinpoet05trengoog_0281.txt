ΑΒΒΟΙ), born in 1035, of au illustr-Ioue family ln
rinion, was choseu bishop of Rennes in 1095, oriu
the yser following, aud having governed with admirable
wisdom his diocese for thirty years, died in 1125. He has
left a large quantity of Latin poetry, iu great part the
versified legende oi saints. His poem De Gemmia was a
great favorite in the middle ages, and hus been often re 1

printed. Itis perhaps worth reading, not aa poetry, ior ss
such it is of very subordinate velue, but as containing the
whole rich mythology of the period in regard of precious
stones und the virtues which were populme attributed to Ἰ
them. Although his poema are for the most part written

in leonine verse, he has shewu in more than one a oon-
suemus suurn the cnseo hexameter. t
