It is true that there wes no collected edition of the works nl
Hildebert until the Benedictine, edited by Beaugendre‚ Paris,
17⁰8. But Usher, in an appendix tohiswork Desmontis, (waren,
w. 7, p. 33b, Eirington's edition) hed nlready printed these lines,
not knowing however the name oi their suthon (ex veteribus
membranis rhythmos istos elegantes descripsimus.) 'l'hey were
also subsequently printed hy iionrmey in his supplementum
