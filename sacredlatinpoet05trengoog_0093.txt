ADAM OF st· VICTOR.

Ritus bovis Lucae datur,
In quit sormi figuratur
Nova Christus hostia:
Arri crucis mansu‘e'tus

Hic mactatur, sicque vetus

fain have all which here finds place.
44. stanni] Clichtoveus, Paris, lton, reads pluant, but the
earlier editions, publiahed in his life-time, as in the text. t
