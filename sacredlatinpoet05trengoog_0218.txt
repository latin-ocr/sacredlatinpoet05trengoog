xm. Glichtoveuo‚ Elocidot. Eooloo„ p. m-There three
otonzoo ore but the fragmento of rather along poem, in which
the moooer of St Lowrence'r martyrdom, (he io said to have
been broiled to death on a gridiron‚) ir brought rather too pro-
minently outr even in there present tho arram of vor. ll
we could willingly hore miroed. Deopito of thio, they ore well
worthy ro find a ploce here, being full of striking imogco, ond
ringuhrly characteristic of their author'o manner-most of oll,
perhaps, of his rich prodigality in the multiplication, and of his
romewhot octonoriouo rkill in tho arrangement, of hir rhymoo.-
St Lowrence was orchdcocon of Romo in the third century, ond
died in the persecution of Valerion. Hir festival vor held in μαι
honour by the Ghurch of the middle rges, rodhe war occounted
to hold o ploce only second to St Stephon, in the gloriouo army os
martyro. (notandus, lectionar, 1. 7. c. 23.)

Hildebort upon o martyrdom ( Opp„ p. 1259) ε

siout chorda colet dore tonso sonum moliorem,
Sic ponit tcnruo dat plenum hudlo honorem
thue probor fornox vu fictile consolidando,
thue luber loto redolere unguenta liquando,
Ut feriendo sopio fervorem vimque sinopis,
thue per ardorem thur undiquc omdrr odorum,
sicodor rnognir flunt ct vulnus et ignis

Si otro tundctur, armum poles spoliant,
Si oomountur, tour robigo putatur.
