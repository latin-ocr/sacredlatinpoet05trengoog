though not itself to be epilt and lost in the process, hut

they left it with the antepenultima long, it could never find place
in the pentameter, and only iu one of its cases in the hexameter,
which induced the almost universal shortening of that syllable
among the metrical writers of the Charch. I cannot but think but
that amid the many motives which prompted the Christian poets to
atrine after emancipation from the classical rules of quantity, first
to slight, aud then to cast them off, this must needs have had its
weightr the opposition to tha metrical scheme lay deeper thau
this, or at least this was but nne moment of it: yet the fact, that
the chiefest metrea absolutely excludes, and rendered impossible
ever to be used, a vast number of the noblest and even most neces·
sacy words, and rendered far more, though not absolutely excluded‚
yet inadmissible in far the greater number of their inflexions,-this
must have been peculiarly intolerable to them. Graving the whole
domain of words for their own, finding it only too narrow for the
uttering of all that they were struggling to express, desiring, too,
as must all whose thoughts and feelings are real, that their words
should fit close to their sense, they could ill endure to be shut out

Ψ from that which often was the best and littest, by arbitrary‚ artificial,

and, as they musthave seemed to them, merely superfluous restric-
tions. 'I'hus Augustine distinctly tells us that the motivo which
iuduced him to compone his very euricus Psalmur contra partem
Dorratt' in tbe rhythm which he did, was that he might not be ham-
pered or confined in his choica of worda by the uecessities of metra.
He saysz Ideo autem non aliquo coracinis genere id fieri volui,
ne me necessitas metrica ad aliqua verba quae vulgo minus sunt
usitata compelleret. Carmen lohere, asso often, used to signify
a poem composed after the old classical models. He would claim
for his own, as being popularly and not metrically written, to be
only aventicum. The two words are brought into direct antithesis,
aad the statelier diction of the carmen indicated by Terentianus
Maurus, 298:

Verba sl non obvia
caminis servant honorem, non jacentis cantici,

Latin prose would be used, are yet under exclusion in verse, 1
