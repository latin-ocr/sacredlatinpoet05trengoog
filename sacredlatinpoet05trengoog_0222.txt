PICTAVENSIS EOOLESIAE.

ΟΟΤΕ quiedam, vit sessus,
Torum premens, somno pressus,

In obscuro noctis densae,
Templum vidi Pictoreum,

XLIII. Hildehcrtt' et Morbodt' opp, p. Ilm—In the Gallio
Christiano, t. 2, p. 1172, the circumstances are deteiled, and at
some length, which alone will enable us fully to enter into and
to understand this noble vision. William Adelelm‚ tha right-
ful hishop of Poitiers‚ aas in 113⁰ violently expelled from his see,
and driven Into exile, hy the fection of the antipope, Anacletus the
second, and of the Gount ol Poitiers‚ who sided with him3 end
en irrtrusive and schIsmatic hishop‚ Peter of Chasteleraut, usurped
his throne, and exercised infinite vexatione and oppressione upon
the Charoh. William aas at length restored in tlte, mahrly
owing to the menacIng remonstrances os St Bernerd. See in his
Life, (Opp.‚ t.2, p. tlte) a most characteristic account of the
manner in thch Bernerd terrified the Count into this restoration.
It was durirrg the period of the usurpatori, end when now it had
lasted three years, (ver. 79-el,) that this poem was composesl. 1
cannot be sure how far the reader'e impression in regard oi it will
coincide with my own, nor whether I may not somewhat overrate
its meritae but certainly it seems to me to deserve something very
different from that ulter oblivion into which it has fallen. 1 know
of no nobles piece of versification‚'nor more slrllful management of
rhyme, in the whole circle of Latin rhyrned poetry.
