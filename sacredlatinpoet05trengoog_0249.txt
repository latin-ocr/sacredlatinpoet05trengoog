L. DE NOMINE JESU.

· ——n-n

ESU dulcis memoria,

Donarem cordi gaudio,
sed super mel el omnia
Ejus dulcis praesentia.

Nil conitor suivius,
Nil cuditur jucundius,
Nil cogitatur dulcius,
Quirn Josus Dei Filius.

Jesu‚ spes poeniienlibuS‚
Quim pius cs petentibus,
Quirn bonus to quaerentibus,
sod quid invenientibus?

poem, among thore of St Bcrncrd perhaps the most eminently ξ

characteristic of ito author, consisto, in ito original form, of nearly
flfty quctrcinr, ond unabrirlged would hare becn too long for in-
sertion hore-not to roy that, with cll the becuty of the rtcnzcs
in particular, the composition, cr ᾳ whole, lieo under the defert
of c certain monotony and wantos progrcor. thre all was becu-
tiful, the carli of relection could not indeed be other than a hard

one; but only in thir way could the poem have found ploce in ,

this volurne; nor, for the reasons just stated, did I feel thot it
would bo merely alors to ir to present it in this brieler form.
