that poetry acted as o conductor of tho thoughts and
images of tho old world to the new, making the stores
of that old world to be again the heritage of the popular
mind-stores which, but-for it, would have been locked
up till the more formal revival of learning, then perhaps
to become, not the possession of the many, bnt only of
the few. How important for the developement of the
human mind was the part which it played, filling up a
space that was ina great measure unocoupied by any
other works of imagination at all; lending to men an
organ by which to utter their thoughts, when as yet the
modern languages of Europe were in the first process os
their formation, and quite unable to be the adequate
clothing for these. ,

’ Thus the earliest form in which the Reinelre Fuehs,
the great fable epic of the middle ages, appeared-the
significanoe of which in European literature, no one
capable of forming a judgment on the matter will
lightly esteem‚—is now aclmowledged to have been Latin.
A poem in four books, in elegiae metre, of which the
author is unknown, supplied mediatcly or immediately
the ground-plan to all tho subsequent dispositions of the
matter. Of course it is not meant hereby to deny the
essentially popular character of the poem, orto affirm
that the Latin poet invented that, which, no doubt, al-
ready lived upon the lips of the people; but only that
in this Latin the table-loro of the German world first
took shape, and found a distinct utteronoe for iuelf1.
