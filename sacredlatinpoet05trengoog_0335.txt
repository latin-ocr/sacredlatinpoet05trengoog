Pas hoc sacrum cataplasma
Convaleacat aegtum plasma. ἵ
Extra portam jam delatum, 105
Jam foetantam, tumulatum,

Sed si jubes, hio resurget ;
Jube, lapis revolvatur,

Jube, vilia dirumpetur:

'l'he second image seems, ln a measure, ιο depart from the miracles
ol the stlllhtg of the amem, (Matt. viii. 263 cf. xiv. 32) and to
introduce a new feature in the puoto,- buton closer inspectionis
will be seen that in the ‘⁶ pirates’' we have only a bold personiii-
cation of the winda and waves, as hi pirata of ver. llll plainly
proves. In the third (senili-128) he contemplatos himself aa
the hasten lig-use of hules xiii. 6-9, and aa such, in donges of
being hewn down. 'l'he fourth image (ves. tto-138) resta plainly
on the healing oi the lunatic child, and especially on the account
of it given hy St Masis, having traits which belong exclusively to
that account, aethe Aquis messaastommts urite (Masis ix. 22.)

The words Tibi soli sum relictus refer to the lailursof the apos- p

tlsa3 “I spake ιο thy disciplss that they should cast him out, and
they could not.” It is aa though he would say, “ Man‘s help is
valna thou must heal me, os none.’' Ἴ
