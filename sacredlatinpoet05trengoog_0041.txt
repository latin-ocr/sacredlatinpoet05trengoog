This movement, then, which began early to mani-
fest itself, for an enfranchisement from the old classical
forms, this impatience of their restraints, was essenti-
ally a Christian one; yet we cannot doubt that it
was assisted and made easier by the fact that the
metrical system, against which the Ohurch protested,
and from which it sought to be delivered, had been
itself brought in from without. Itself of foreign growth,
it could oppose no such stubbom resistance as it would

have done, had it been native to the soil, had its roots ¹

been cutwined firmly with the deepest foundations of
the Latin tongue.

It is abundantly known to all who take any interest
in the early poetry of Rome, that it was composed on
principles of versification altogether different from those
which were introduced with the introduction of the

Greek models in the sixth century of the Oity—that 2

Latin hexameters, or “ long” verses, were in all proba-

bility first composed by Ennius¹, while the chief lyric ³

metres belong to a much later day, haring been in-
troduced, some of the simplet kinds, as for instance
the sapphic, by Catullus, end the more elaborate not
till the time, and only through the successful example,
of Horace 2. It is known too that while the hexameter

she claime: this would not trouble us, since, ultimately, where trutlr

is, there highest beauty must be as well. But such facts as t

these, cr as the hideous Italian Churches of the last three hun-
dred years, need to be explained and accounted for, before she can
make good her claim.
