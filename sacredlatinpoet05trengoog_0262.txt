LIV-⁸ Mohnilre‚ Hymrtolopiscbc Forachurryen, Stralsund,
1832, v. 2, p. ioh-This is a good translation, perhaps as good as
could bemade, of hather’s “Heldenlied,’'asit wallhasbeen called,

Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott:

the hymn, among all with which he ‚has enriched the Church, the

most characteristic oi the man, the truest utterance of his great
heart. It must be confessori that much of the heroic strength of

the original has vanishcd in the translation3 yet, beside its merite,
which ara considerable, it ls interesting as showing the great phi-
lologist whose worlr it is, in scmewhat a novel aspect. It was lirst
published in 1830, shortly aiter Buttmann's death, on the occasion

citha third jubiles tc celebrate the publication oi the confession of
Augsburg. It is well known that the original hymn was probably
composed in 1530, during the time the Diet was sitting.
