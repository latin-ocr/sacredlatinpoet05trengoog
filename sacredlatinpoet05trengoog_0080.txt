sacred song: lor, in later times, Santeul truly a very dii-
ferent kind oi poet from him with whom now we have io
do, was a Victorino as well.

Very different estimates have been formed of the merito
of Adam of St Victor's hymns. llis greatest admirere will
hardly deny that he pushes too far, and plays overmuch

with, his skill in the typica] application of the Old Teste-
ment¹ss So too they must own thet sometimes he is unable

to fuse with a perfect success his manifold learned allusion
into the passion of his poetry. How full of this learned

¹ calderon seems otton to me, consciously or unconsciously, an imi-
tator ol Adam os St Victor’s manner-initting together, as he does, a
succession ot allusione to Old Testament types, and wearing them with
more or less success into the wool oi a single poem. This hymn, maon
from an Anto oi his, on the Holy Eucharist, will serve as an illustration
otwhatlmean: ⁰

Honey in the lion’s mouth,
Emblem mystical, divine,
How the street and strong combine,
Cloven rock for Israel’s drouth;
Treasnre house oi golden grain,
By our loseph laid in store, ,
ln his brethren’s lamine sore .
Freely to dispenso again, ’
Deir on Gideon’s snowy fleece3
Well from bitter¹ changed to sweet3
Shew-bread laid in order meet,
Bread whose cost doth ne’er increase
'l'hough no rein in April salle
Horeh’s manna, freely given,
Showered in white dew from heaven,
Marcellous, angelicam
Weightiest bunch ot Canaan's vinee
Cake to strengthen and sustain
'l'hrough long days ol desert pain3
Salem’s monarch’s breed and winet—
Thou the antidoto shalt be
Oi my siciness and my sin,

’ consolation, medicine,
In'le and Sacrament to me.
