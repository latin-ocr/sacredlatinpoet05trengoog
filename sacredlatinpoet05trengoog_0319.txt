Hoc in templo, summe Deus,
Exoretus adveni,

Et clementi bonitate

Precum vota suscipe,
Largam benedictionem

Hic infunde jugiter.

Hic pronrereaniur omnes
Petite acquirere,

37-tu There tvo last stannes ef thie hymn, Daniel, (v. l,
p. rto), conceives not to have belonged tc it, as first composed5
that it vas simply e yeeming after the heavenly city, with no
relation ιο the dedication of a material temple, and that these vvere
added, when, at a later period, it was turned tn this use c Hrec su-
perne civitatis laudatio, ut mihi videtur, ex poete consilio nihil
spectsbet ed Festum Dedicationie, neque ultra versum decimum
octavum genuinam esse puto. Quae sequuntur v. 19-24, illo tem·
pore adjecti sunt, quo nostrum centicutn in Ecclesie usum conver-
tebatur. But this is certainly emirtalre. The hyrnn coheres inti-
metely in all its parts, and ιο turn it away from its purpose of
being ahymn In Dediccticnc Ecclesia, is ιο rob it of its chiefest
beauty. It is rnost truly a hymn “of degrees,” an ascending from
things earrhly ιο things heavenly, and s making of the first ιο be
interpretem of the last. Durendus (liclimah, l. l, c. l, §. 7-10,
and elsewhere] shevs how the prevailing thought in the building
and the dedication of a church, with the rites thereto apperteining,
was to carry up men's thoughts from thet temple built with hands,
which ves before their eyes, to thet other built of living stenes in
heaven, of which thie vas buta wealr shedovv. Compare tvo
beautiful sermons by Hildebert, p. 641, otc, Beaugendre's edit.
A sequence which Daniel himself gives, (v. 2, p. 23,) should heve
hindered him from falling into this error. It, ιοο, is entitled Dc
Dedicctiooc Ecclesiae, and thus commences r
