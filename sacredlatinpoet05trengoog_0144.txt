ST BERNARD.

Τ Berncrd, born in 1091, of s noble family, st Fontaine

in Burgundy, become in 1113 s monk of Citeeux, end
in 1115 first sbbot 01 Cleirveux. Hc died Aug. 20, 1153.
There heve been other men, Augustino end Luther for
instance, who by their words end writiugs heve ploughed
deeper and more lusting furrows in the great field of the
Church, but probably no men during his liietime ever
exercised a perrona! influenoe in Christendom equcl 10 his ς
who wus the stcyer of popular commotione„ the queller 01
hercsies, the umpire between princes end kingr, the coun-
sellor 01 popes, the founder, for sobe may be esteemed, 01
an importent religious order, the author of e crusade.
Resides cll deeper quelities which would not alone heve
sufficed to effect cll this, he was gifted by nature end grece
with rcrest powers 01 persuasion, (Doctor mellifluus ns he
wusrightly called, though the honcy perhaps wes some-
times s little too honied,) end seems to have exerciseda
wellnigh megiccl influenoe upon ull those with whom he
was brought into contect. The hymns which usually go by
his name were judged away from him on very slight end
insufficient grounds, by Mcbillon, in his edition of St Ber-
nerd’s works. But with the exception 01 the Cur mundus
militat, there is no resson to doubt the correctness of their
attribution to him. All inter-nel evidence is in favour of
him cs their author. 11 he did not write, it is not eesy to
guess who could heve written, them3 end indeed they beer

profoundly the stcmp 01 his mind, being only inferior in

becuty to his prose.
