selvas, on the part of the champions of the other theory,
in regard of horo the Saturnian verse should bo scanned,
and what feet we are even to look for in it, certainly
oi iteelf affords a strong presumption against thern.

Into what these numbers would have unlolded
themselves, as the nation advanced in culture, and ae
the ear, gradually growing nicer and more exacting in
its requiremauts‚ claimed a finer melody, it is not easy
to say; bnt Roman poetry at all events, as it would
have had a character, so would it have rested on a basis
of versification, which was ita own. And knowing thia,
we can scarcely sympathine without reservo in the
satisfaction of Horace at the change which presently
caure over it 3 however we may admit that, with the
exception of his one greater cotemporary, he accom-
plished ruore than any other, to excusa and justily,
and even to reconcilc us to, the change. That change
came, as iufamiliar to all, when, instead of being
allowed such a process of natural developement from
within, it was drawn out of its own orbit by theton
prevailing attractione cf the Greek literature, within
whose influence the conquesta of the aixth century
brought it,—though indeed, that influence had com-
menced nearly a century before.

It is, indeed, a perilous moment for a youthlnl lite-

turinga rhythm. Numeri is only abunively applied to verses which
rest on music and time, and not on the number of the syllables.
