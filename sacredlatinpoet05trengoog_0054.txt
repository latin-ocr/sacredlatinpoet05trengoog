can hardly doubt that these coincidences of sound were
sedulously avoided by so great a master oi the pro-
prieties as Virgil-in whose works therefore rhyming
verses rarely appear: while it is difficult not to suspect
that they were sometimes sought, or, if not sought, yet
not diligently 'shunned, but rather welcomed when they
offered themselves, by an Ovid, in whom they occur far
more frequently, and whose less severe toste might not
have been unwilling to appropriate thie as well as
the more legitimate adomments which belong to the
verse that hc was using.

They occur indeed, verses with middle and final
rhymes, in every one of the Latin poete. Thus, as ex-
amples of the middle rhyme, we have in Ennius:

Non cauponantes bellum, sed belligerantem
And in Virgil:

Limus ut hic durescit, et hec ut cera liquescit3

Ι So too in Ovid:

Quem mare carpentem, substrictaque crura gerentem

rcnce of words similarly ending afl'ords to the ear. Thus Cicero
himself (Brut. 87)= Volvendi sunt libri Catonisr intelliges nihil
illins lineamentis, nisi eorum pigmentorum, quse inventa nondum
erant, florem et colorem defuisse. So Pliny the younger: Illam
ocrem et merom Graeciam. And Plautusoentett, l, 1.7o): Amor
et melleet selle cst fecundissimus. In the Christian prose-writers
they are more frequent still, especially in Augustius. All readers
of his villremember how osten such chimes as this recur: Lingua
chmel, cor amon or, on the tvo Testaments: In Novo patent,
quse in Vetere lauat: or, on the Christian's “ hope of glory,'' Prte-
cedst spes, nt sequatur ces. Ntke (ntes. Murcum, 1829, p.

. :tat-eol) has accumulated examples of a like kind from almost all

the hstin prosc-writers
