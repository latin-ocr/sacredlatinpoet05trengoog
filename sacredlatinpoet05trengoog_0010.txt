mitted to observa that I do' not thereby imply that
every single phrase of every poem which it con-
tains exaetly meets my desire-that there is not,
. here and there, that which one would willingly have
had otherwise expressed. Two or three'phrases also
there may be‚--yet not, l believe, mora-which in
their doctrinal aspeets will claim of the reader the
interpretation of charity, and that he remember
how unfair it is to try the theological language of
the middle ages hy the greater strictness end accu-
racy of a happier theology. Thus, for us at this
day to talk of any “ments'' save those of Christ,
aster all that the Reformation has won for us,
would involve a consoious anda deliberate falling
away from a sole and exclusive reliance upon
his work. But it was a different thing then, and
the word might quite be used by one who had
implicitly an entire affiance on the work of Christ
for him as the ultimate ground of his hope; and
who only waited to have the truth, which with
some confusion he held and lived by, put before
him in accurate form, to embraee it heneeforth
and for ever, not only with heart, as he had done
* already, but with the understanding as well.
Nor yet do I mean to affirm thet there may
not heve found admission here one or two poems
which some, whom lshould greatly heve desired ’

i' altogether to have carried with me in my seleo-
