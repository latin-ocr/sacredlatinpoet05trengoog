ROBERT THE SECOND, KING OF
FRANCE.

----..

ΗΕ lordicat—for however not the greatest, euch we eall

it-of ull the hymno in the whole oirole of Letin eoored
poetry, hue a king for its author. Robert ¹the Second, eon of
Hugh Cepet, euooeeded hie lether on the throne of Franco in
the year 997. He wee singulmly eddioted to Chureh-
musio, which he enriohed, ee well ee the hymnology, with
compositione of hie own, euch ue, 1 believe, even now
hold their ploce in the services oi the Romieh Chureh.

Even were the story of the writer'e life unknown to

ue, we should guees thet the hymn whioh follows oould

only heve been oompoeed by one who hed hnd acquaint-
enoe with many sorrows, eud eleo with many consolatione.
Nor should we err herein: for if the oonsoletione ere plain
from the poem iteelss the hietory of those times oonteine
the record of the menifold sorrowe, within his own family
und without it, which were the portion of thie meelr and
greatly efflicted king. Siemondi (Hiot. doe Franfao, t. 4,
p. 98-111,) brings him very vividly before ue in ull the

beeuty of hie character, end eleo in ell hie evident unfit·
ueee, emon of gentleneee und peace, for greppling with

the men of iron by whom he wee eurrouuded. He died j

in 1031.
