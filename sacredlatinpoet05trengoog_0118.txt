mr NATIVI'PATE norum. 93

VII. DE NATIVITATE DOMINI.

UER natus in Bethlehem,
Unde gaudet Jerusalem.

Hic jacet in presepio,
Qui regnat sine termino.

Cognovit bos et asinus
Quod puer erat Dominus.

VII. Comes, Prompt, Deoot„ p. 27& Daniel, Thea. Hymnol„
v.,l‚ p. 334. This hymn, of a very beautiful simplicity, and eb-
sorbing easily and naturally sc much theology in ita poetry‚ and in
many ways containing ao much in a brief compass, continued long
a great favourite in the Lutheran Churches of Germany. Its use
indeed survived among them till wellnigh the present dey. It
sometimes appears at nearly twice the length at which I heve given
itt but all which is more then this looks like filling up, and in.
jmes rather thau promotes the effect of the whole.

ὅ. Boe et erinna] Two passages in the Old Testament sup·
plied the groundwork to thet wide-spread legend which painters of
the Nativity heve so often made their own, and to which here the
poet allodes, viu, that the ox and the aas recognized and worshipped Ι
that lrord whom the Jews ignored and rejected. 'l'he first and
principel of these ia of course lsai. i. 3: Cognovit bos possessorem
suum, et asinus presepe domini suis Israel autem me nou cog·
novit, et populus meus uon intellexit. (vulg.) There was seen
here a prophetie reference to the manger at Bethlehem 3 and no
less at Heb. iii. 2, where the Septuagint has strangely enough, ἐν
μέσῳ δύο ζώων γνωσθήσῃ, being followed here'm by theold Italic:
In medio duorum animalium innotesceris.
