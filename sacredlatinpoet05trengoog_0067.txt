deience, being, as it is, the proof that it lies deep in
our human nature and satisfies an universal need, since
else so many people would not have come upon it, or
having come, so inflexibly maintained it.

For we do encounter it everywhere—in the fur-
thcst Weet, in the earliest Celtic poems, Wclsh and
' Irish-in the extremest East, among tho Ohinese, in
the Senserit—and no less in the Persian and Arabio
poetry, in the Gothic and scandinaviam-no formal dis-
covery, as no borrowed skill, in any case ; but in all the
well nigh instinctivc result of that craving after periodic
recurrence, proportion‚ limitatum-of that sense out of
which ell rhythm and all mette springs, namely, that
the streame of passion must have baalis within which
to flow, if they are not to wasto· and lose themselves

quite—with the desire to mark and to make distinctly
noticenble to the ear these limite and restraints, which
the werse, for its own ultimate good, impcses upon itseli1.

¹ Ewald (On tte Poetic Baete os the Old Postumum, v. l,
p. oi) has expressed himself very profoundly on this matter: “A
stream of words and images, en overflowing and impetuous diction,
a movement which in its first violence seems to know no bounds
nor control-such is the earliest manifestation ol poetic diction!
But a diction which should only continue in this its earliest move-
ment, and hurry onward, without bounds and without measure,
would soon destroy its own beauty, even its very life. Yea rather,
the more living and overfiowing this onward movement is, by so
much the more needful the restraint end the limitation, the coun-
teraction and tranquilliaation, of this becomes. This mighty in-
spiration and exspiration ; this rise with its commensurate fall; this
advance in symmetrical diction, which shall combine rest and mo-
tion with one another, and mutunllyrecoucile them; this is rhythm,
or regulated beautiful movement.’'
