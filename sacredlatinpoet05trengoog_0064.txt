Seeing thot these things are so, and that it lies in
our power tc traca thus distinctly, and as it were step
by step, the whole rise and grcwth ci the Latin rhymed
poetry, to preside oven ot its birth and at its credie,-
it certainly seems strange that so many should have
affirmed that it horrowed its rhyme from languages,
which assuredly du not now preserve any examples in
this kind which are not of a very iar lator date than
much which we possess in the Latin tongue. These
are the words oi one who has made a study cf the
subject¹: “I lrncw of no poem written in a Gothic
dialect with final rhyme, before Otirid's Evangely. This
was written in Franhish, about the year 870.·' It is

Celtic raca-among which undoubtedly it existed very
early, the Welch using it as early as the oth century-
and, having thus derived it irem them, to have in their
turn imparted it to the Gothic natione. But a necessity
for 'this unlikely hypothesis rests only on his strange
mistaks, that “the Romans were confessedly ignorant
