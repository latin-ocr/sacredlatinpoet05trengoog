Oro supplex et acclinia,
Oor contritum quasi cinis:
Gere curam mei finis.

ol, It ia not wonderful that a poem auch aa thia should
have continually allmed, and continually defied, umtlatora. We

have several veraiona in English, beginning nith a very noble
one by Graabav, in hia Stapa lo the Templa, London, 1648, p. 105;
it ia in quatraina, aad rather a reproduction then a translation t· and
including one by Walter Scott. In German they are yet more
numerous, and there alac include higheat names, auch aa ilerden
Fichte‚ and Augustus Schlegel. 1 have a volume before me by
nram, exclusively dedicated to there. It vav publiahed in loto,
and contains forty-tbree versione. And in an Appendic, which fol-
lowed three years alter, serenteen moneare given, vhich either
hed before eacaped the editors notice, or had been publiahed since
the publication of hit book. Among theae, it ia true, there is one
French and one Romaic; but all the reat are German.
