1 will avail myself cf the present opportunity to say something
about the leonine verses, and the other kinds of verse, more or less
nearly related to the leonine, which figure so prominently in the
literary productioris of those eges. The name leonine, which is
sometimes, although wrongly‚ extended to lines with final as well
'es with sectional or internal thymos, has been variously derived
from various persons of the name of Leo, who were presumed first
to have written them. Thus Eberhard:

Sunt inventoris de nomine dicta Leonis.

Or oftener still they have been derived from one hecnius or heo·
ninus, a canonos Notre Deme and Latin versifier of the leth
century. The derivation of the name from him is a curicus
example oi' the manner in which literary opinions once started are
repeated again and again, no one taking the trouble to enquire
into their truth. For, in the first place, it is perfectly certain
that leonine verses existed long before his time. 11⁴ this needed
proving, Muratori (Anti. stat, Diss. 40) has abundantly proved it,
adducing peri'ect leonine verses which belong to the eth, eth, and
loth centuries. Among many more, these, which do not date later
than the eth:

J Arbor sama Crucis iit mundo semita lucis;
Quam qui portavit, nos ciuistus in astra levarit
And thus too J. Grimm (Larcio. θεά. d. x. a. x1.'JH., p.
xxiv.): In Deutschland esscheinen leoninische Verse gleich mit
dem Beginn der lateinischen Dichtkunst, und sind die Lieblings-
form der Minthe vom neunten bis zum iunfsehnten Jahrhundert.
This objection lias sometimes been sought to bs ended, by the
supposition that Leonius, though not the first to compose, was the
first to bring these verses to any perfectiori. (Marcioni, v. 3.
p. 687). But this is only propping up error with errore for Edele-
stand du Meril affirms (Poiss'es populaires Latinas, p. 78) from
actual inspection, thatin his poetry‚ which inconsiderable in bulk,
