the knowledge of some who would not otherwise hare known it; or
if they had, would not hare believed its worth, but that the sege
and seer cithia world had thus stood sponsor to it, and set his seal of
recognition upon it 'l'be sublime use which G'o'the bas mede ot' it
in that drama will be remembered by all. 'l'o another illustrious
man tbis hymn was eminentiy deur. How affecting is that incident
recorded oi Sir Walter Scott by his biographer-horr in the last
days oi his liie, when all oi his great mind bad failed or was
iuiling, he was yet heard to murmur to himself some lines of this
hymn, which had been an esperial favourite with him in other
days. Nor is it hard to understand or explain the wide and general
popularity which it has enjoyed. 'Phe metre so graudly derised,
of which 1 remember no other example, fitted though ithae bere

in a christian hymn, and bearing witness to Christian trutb, has
occasioned another reading here, and we sometimes meet Crucis
repondens ueailla, as the last line oi this first triplet. It rests on
Matr. xxiv. 30, and on the notion that tbe apparitiou oi a cross in
the sky would be “the sign of the Son oi man in heaven” there
spoken oi. 'l'here is no doubt, however, that it is a iate alteration
. oi the text; aud tbe line as it stands abore, is quite in the spirit
oi the early and medieral theology. Iu those ages the Sibylline
verses were not seen to be that nansparent iorgery which indeed
they aret but were continually appeaied to aa standing only second
to the sacred Scriptores in prophetie authority. 'l'hus see the use
