Lxlx. DE GLORIA ET GAUDIIS PARADISI.

D perennis vita fontem mens sitivit avida,
Claustra carnis praesto frangi clausa quaerit auima3
Gliscit, ambit, eluctatur, exul frui patrib.

Dum pressuris ac arumnis se gemit obnoxiam,
Quam amisit, dnm deliquit, contemplatur gloriam3 5

Praesens malum auget boni perditi memoriam.

Nam quis promat summas pacis quanta sit laetitia,
Ubi vivis margaritis surgunt edificia,
Auro celsa micant tecta, radiant triclinia?

H ymnol„ v. 1, p. llo-This poem has been often, but erroneourly‚
attributed to Augustinee evidently on the ground that it finds
place in the Medicorum, which were long ascribed to that Father.
These Meditattonee, however, are plainly a cento from Anselm,
Gregory the Great, and many othere besides Augustinee from
whom they are rightly adjudged away by the Benedictlne editors,
aa indeed they hed already been in earlier editions. 'l'he hymn is
undoubtedly Damieni's, and quite the first and greatest which
hehasleftus.
