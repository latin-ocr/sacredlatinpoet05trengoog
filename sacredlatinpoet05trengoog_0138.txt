Guizot (Cioilhatimz en Frauee,18meLecon,) must be
taken to allow it. Yet hsd Fortunatus been merely thet
elever, friuolous, sels-indulgent end vein character, thet
Thierry describes, he would scorcelp⁷ heve risen to the height
end elevetion which, in two or three of his poems, he has
certainly ettoined ;-poems, it is true, which¹ ere inconceiv-
ebly superior to the mess of those out oi which they ere
tehen· ln Bnrth's Adversaric there is the seme exagge-
reted estimato of Fortunatus which there is of Prudentius,
aud with fer less in his posey to justify or excuse it. It
would indeed heve been otherwise, hsd he often written es
iu the lines which follow.

XV. DE CRUCE CHRISTI.

—-———

RUX benedicte nitet, Dominus qud carne pependit,
Atque cruore suo vulnero nostre lavat.
Mitis amore pio pro nobis victims sactus,
¹ Traxit eb orelupi qut secer agnus oves.
Transfixis palmis ubi mundum ὲ clade redemit, 5
Atque suo clausit funere mortis iter.
Hic manus illa fuit clavis confixa cruentis,
Quae eripuit Paulum crimine, morte Petrum.

e far longer poem ;.yet heve e completeness in themselves which
hes long caused them to he current in their present shepe, till it is
elmost forgotten thet they only form pert of e lsrger whole.
