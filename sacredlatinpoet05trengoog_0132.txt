and Virgil of the Christian& Extraragant praiaco, com-
pensated on the other side by as undue depreciation. For
gising, as it must be ownedv he does, many and distinct
tokens of belonging to an oge of deeply sunken toste, yet
was his gift of sacred poetrya most truc ono; and when it
is charged against him in the Dictiouary os Greek aad
Roman Btopropty, thet “his hatinity is not formed, like
that of «Iuvencus and Victorinus, upon the best ancient
moden, but is confessedly impure‚'' this is really his
praise‚—namely, that, whether conscionsly or unconsoiously,
he did act on the principle, thet the new life claimed new
forms in which to manifest iacit-thot he did not shrink
from helping forward thet great transformation of the
Latin language, which it had need to undergo, now that it
was to be the vehicla of truths which were altogether novel ’
to it, having not yet risen up above tho horizon of men's
minds, at the time when it was in its first growth and for-
mation. Let any ono compare his poems with those of Ju-
venons or Sedulius, ond his vast superiority will be at once
manifest—that superiority mainly consisting in this, that he
does not attempt, ss they did, to pour the new wine into
old bottles3 bnt has felt and understood that tho new
thoughts and feelings which Christianity hus brought into

the world, must of necessity weavo new garments for them-
solves.

The poema on which the reputation of Prudentius asa
poet mainly rests, are his Cathemerinon=Diuroorum The
tenth, Deus, ignee Fons unimammis confessedly the grand-
est of them all. The first also, on Cockcrow, and the
twelfth, an Hymn for Epiphany, though they attain not to
the grandeur of this, may well share with it in our
admiration.
