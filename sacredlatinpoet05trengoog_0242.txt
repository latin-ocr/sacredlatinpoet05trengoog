ILLIAM Alnrd, born1572, and descended from n

noble family in Belgium, wss tho son oi Francis
Alord, o confessor of the Reforrned Fcith during the perse-
cutions of the Duke of Alvs, Hardly escaping from the
Low Countries with his life, the father settled in Holstein,
st the invitation oi Christian the Fourth, king of Denmsrk.
For three or four generations the family, which appears to
hnve established itself there, or in the neighbouring parts of
Germsny, was distinguished in the wulks of theology aud
classioal learning. Besides other works which Willinm
compcsed, hc was the author of two small volumes of Latin
hyms, which, however iorgotten now, appear to have found
much favour ot the time of their publication: Eoccbiarum
piarum Centurio, Lipsiae‚1623; aud Eccubiurum piorum
Centurio Secundo, 16283 1 believe thst there was also a
third century, though it bns never como under my eye. Of
the first Centum four editions were published iu the author’s
lifetinre. He died Pastor ol Krempe in Holstein iu 1645.
