ADAM OF ST VICTOR.

1⁴¹ the life of Adam of St Victor, the most fertile, eud,

es I em inclined to believe, the greatest ol the hetin
hymnologists of the middle eges, very littleis known. He
eppeers to heve been e uetive of Brittnny, although the
tcrms hemo, brito, by which the curly writers thet mention
his neme designate him, leave in some doubt whether
l'lnglend might not heve hod the honour oi giring him
birth. The authors ol the Histoire Litttroire de lc Franco,
t. 1o,p.4o—4o, think thet there ere some probebilities in
favour oi this supposition. Yet the feet thet lhonce wne
undoubtedly the greet'seet of Latin poctry in the 12th cen-
tury, end thet ull the chief composers in this kind, es Hilde-
bert, the two Bernerds, Merbod, Peter the Venereble, were
Frenchmen, leaves it fer more likely thet he, the chiefest of
ull, wes such es well. At nll events he mede his studies et
Puris, where hc entered the religione foundation of st
Victor, then in the suburbe, but et a luter dey inoludod '
within the wells, oi Poris, in which he continued to his
deeth. The yeer of his death isunknown; the Gallio Chris-
tiano seys veguely, thet he died between 1173 eud 1194,
His epiteph, grewen on e pluto of copper in the cloister of St

Victor, near the door of the ohuroh, romeined till the gene- .

rel deetnrction ot the first Resolution. lt isworthy to bs
