Quatuor diversitatis
Asiani animalia.

12. animalia] 'l'he ζῶα of Rev. iv. 6, &c.‚ in the Vulgate
rightly animalia, is in our version not heppily translated “beuta'’
It plainly should hove been, as in Eaehiel, “living creatures,’' and
“ beast '' should have been reserved for the nit-recurring θηρίου of
the leth ond later chapters. The distribution made in this hymn
of the t'our living creetures to the four evangeliste is St J erome's,
( Comm. in Επεὶ. c. l, Prol. in Motth. end Ep. dih) is thet of
St Ambrose, (Prol. in Luo.‚)'and, aiter them, thet os Gregory the
Great, (Hom. t. in Erclt.,· Merui, l. 31, c. 47,) and no doubt
through the lnfluence os the latter became the prevailing one,

l though not the exclusive one, (for Bede has another,) during the‘
, middle ages. ln earlier times there ves great fluctuation in the
¹ applicetion of the sour to the loun and strengely enough even the

engle was not by any universal consent attributed to St Johnc on
the contrary, Irenoeus, the first who makes the applicetion stall,
gives the lion to him, end the eagle to St llarlr, (Coo. Her. ta, c.
¹2, § 8,) leaving however the other two unaltered ι and so J uvcncus
in a brief poem on the subject. Athanasius (opp, v. 2, p. lto)
shifts them in yet another fashion. hearing St Metthew un·
touched, he gives the cali to St Marii, the lion to St bule, and the
engle to St John. And Augustine, (Dc coo. Eoony.,l l, c. 7,)
whom Bede follows, makes yet another transposition. With him
the lion belongs to St Meroen, theman to St Marii, the cali und
eagle respectively to St lruke and St John. One might be tempted
by these variatione to dismiss the whole matter as an idle play of
thefancy3 yet more thsn this undoubtedly there was, and indeed a
deep insight into the nature of the Gospels in the desire which thus

¹ menifested itself of claiming t'or thern tobe atonce t'our audone, an

εὐαγγέλιον τετράμορφον, (Irenaeus,) τετράγωνον, (origem) to be
the setters forth, in four cardinal aspects, oi the inexhaustible ful-¹
nese of the lile of Christ-a matter into which however Imay not
nter here. Far the fullest and most satisfactory account ol' the

utintc aspect oi the subject is to be found in liirs Jameeon's
Poetry os Soored ond Legmdory Art, v. l, pp. 98-110.
