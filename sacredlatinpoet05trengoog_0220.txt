XLII. Casander, Hymni Ecclesiastici, (Opera, Paris, itio.)
, p. 281.-'l'hesestanzas form part of one of the eleven hymns which
Cassander attributed to Bede, end published for the first time in
his Hymni Eeclesiosmss Paris, 1556ς and which appear again in
the collected edition of Cassander's worlcs, referred to above The
last editor of the works of Beue, Dr Giles, llas not been able to
find any MS. containing these hymno, and though he has not ex-
cluded them, expresses (v. l, p. clxxi.) many doubts in regard of
their authenticity. Whether they are Bede's or not, 1 must express
my dissent from the judgemeut of his editor in one respect, since,
whatever may be the velue of the poena as a whole, these lines at
least which follow, appear to me tohave a very real worth.
