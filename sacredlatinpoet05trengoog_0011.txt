one of the mischiefs which Rome hus entailed upon
the whole Western Church, even upon those por-
tione of it which heve now escaped her tyranny,
thet she hes rendered suspicions so much, which,

those, who above ell things would be true to God's ,
word, ostentimes to act in the spirit of Hezekieh ,

when he said “Nehushtan'’ to the very “sign of sel-
vstion¹''-to the brenen serpent itself. Yet grent-
ing thet the superstitious, and therefore profane,
hands which she hes laid on so much, must otten-
times make it our wisdom, and indeed our duty,
thet we ebridge ourselves of our rightful liberty in

many things, which otherwise and but for her
we might have freely end profitebly used, there is

still a limit to these sels-denials: end unless we
ere determined to set such u limit, there is no
point of bareness and nakedness in all of imagi-
1 notive and symbolic in worship end service, which
we might not reech; even as some Reformed
Churches, which heve not shewn that minglcd
moderatiori end firmness, that heve in these mat-
ters so wonderfully characterized our own, have

undoubtedly mode themselves much poorer than χ

was need.
