We may observe that the prosodic poetry of Greeoe and
Rome was equally obliged to mark this, though it did
it in another way. For example, had dactyles and
spondees been allowed to he promiscuously used in
every part of the hexameter line, if once the hearer had
lost the termination of the line, it would hare been
almost impossible for him to recover it: at any rate, no
satisfying indication would have reached his ear, that
the verse was ending. But the fixed dactyle and spon-
dee cf the conclusion answer the same purpose of
strongly marking the close, as does the rhyme in the
accentual verse: and in other menes, in like manner,
licenses permitted in the beginning of the line arc ex·
cluded at its closo, the motives for this greater strict-

It is the nen-recognition of this, man's craring after,
and deep delight in, the rhythmic aad perindie-a crav-
ing which nature everywhere meets and gratifice, and
which all tmest art seeks tc gratify as well,-a secing
nothing in all this but a triok and artifice applied from
without-this itis which lies at the root of thet singular
theory concerning the unfitncss cf poetry to be a vehicle
for our highest addresses to (iod, and most reuerent
utterances about Him, which the accomplished author of
the Doy ira the Sanctoary has enounoed in the prefate
to that volume. Any one who, with near the skill in
versification and command over languagc which he him-
self has manifested elsewhere, undertakes to comply

with the requirements which verse impones, knowe that ¹

the necessity for so doing is indeed no bondage, hut
