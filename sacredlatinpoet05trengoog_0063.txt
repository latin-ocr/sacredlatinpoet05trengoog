or an' Adam ¹of St Victor, it displayed all its latent
capacities, and attained its final glory and perfection,
satiating thc ear with a richness os melody that scarcely
is anywhere to be surpassed. At first tho rhymes
were often merely vowel or assonant ones, the con-
sonante not being required to agree ; or the rhyme was
adhered to, when it was convenient, hut, when it eost

Christendom: Ges hymnes sont versiliee d‘apres la regie dele
matrique ancienne, mais il est curieux de voir une tendances
la rime se produire evidemment dans ces strophes eneloguee 1
celles d'Horaoe. Ge qui aera le fondement de la prosodie des
