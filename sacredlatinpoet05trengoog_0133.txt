XIII. DE SS. INNOCENTIBUS.

——u—u—

ALVETE, flores martyrum,
Quos lucis ipso in limine
Christi insecutor sustulit,
Ceu turbo noscentes rosus.

Grex immolatorum tener,

Aram unte ipsam simplices
“ Pulmi el coronis tuditis.

Audit tyrannus anxius
Adesse regum Principem, κ 10

snd is so skillully put together, that 1 heve neither excluded it,
nor attempted to restore it to the form in which it appears in the
text of the poet. As s whole, the hymn, es he wrote it, would heve
been far too long for insertion, end is not without some serious
offences egelnst trste3 while no exhact would hove the complete-
ness which this both in itselfpossesses, sud of which it hes besides
required the sense, by long use rud currency in its present form.
