Life os Jeeus Christ, of which some may remember a most
offensive reproduotion a few years since in Englend. If
indeed thet Pectore ostie Virptn be his, of which heppin
there are very considerable doubts, it is too plain that he
did not merely acquiesce in that amount of worship oi the
creature which he found, but was also its enthusieetic
promoter to e yet higher and wilder pitch then before it
hed reached. Luther, who cells him, Beneventum, pra-
stantissirnus vir, could scarcely have supposed that it wes
with any rIght attributed to him. His Letin poetryis good,
but does not call for any especial criticism.

XIX. IN PASSIONE DOMINI.

UAM despectus quem dejectus,
Q Rex ooelorum est effectus,

Ut salvaret saeculum3
Esurivit et sitivit,

Pauper et egenus ivit
Usque ad patibulum.

Recordare paupertatis,
Et extremae vilitatis,
Et gravis supplicii.
Si es compos rationis,

Esto memor passionis,
Fellis, et absinthii.

XIX. Beneventum Oppâ€ž Lugduni, 1668, v. 6, p. 423.
