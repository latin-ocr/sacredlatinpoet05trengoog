rauce, soughi to find a compensatiou for this iu similar
oloses io the verse: and very far was it ai first from

Est pluris bellus sonipes quam parvus asellus,
Hoc equitabo pecus, si mihi desit equus.
And here is a bitter epigram on the billeiaci the middle ages, one
of the many passages which bridge over the space between the
word's original and present meaning:

Quando mulcetur villanus, pejor habetur:

Ungentem pungit, pungentem rusticus ungit
Being easily recollected, they were much in use to assist keepirrg
in remembrarrce the arrangement of the Church calendar, and the
order of the Festivals. Durandus in his Rationale often alludcs to
and quotes them, as at 1. 8. c. 3. dames Grimm observes on them
well: Iu ihnen ergeht sich die Kloster-poesie am behaglichsten,
und ihre Feierlichheit fordert sie: daher Inscriften fiir Gr’dber
und Gloclren‚ lrleinere Spriiche und Memorabilien fast nur in
ihnen versasst wurdena sie ts‘inen auch nicht seiten klangvoll und
prachtig. Thus on the iillet oi a church·bell it was common to
have these lines:

Festa sonans mando, cum funem praelia pando;
ideque rugit quando resono cum fulmine grando.

The Frankish monarche, as claiming to be Roman emperors, had
a leonine verse on their seals= '

Roma caput mundi regit orbis iraena rotundi.

In most of these lines it will hardly be denied that there is a
certain strength and energy. Here is a somewhat longer specimen ε
the verses are drawn from a poem by Reginald, an English
Benedictine monk, tha cotemporary and friend of Anselm and
of Hildebertr

Saepe jacet ventus, dormit sopita juventus:
Aura vehit lenis, natat undis cymba serenis;
AEquore sed multo Nereus, custode sepulto,
Torquet et invertit navem dum navita stertit:
Mergitur et navis. quamvis vehat aura suavis:
Bes tandem blanda sunt mortis eausa nefande.

drawn, and further quotations which are hy no means without an
elegante of their own, may be found in Sir A. croore’s Essag on
