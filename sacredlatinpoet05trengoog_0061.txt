thet elaborate and perfect instrument which it alter-

wards became. We may traco ii step by step from iis ἵ

the Historyos Rhyminy Latin Verte, pp. tet-75. These too of
Hildebert’s on the Crucifixion are goods

vita subit letum, dulcedo potat ocenum:
Non homo sed vermis, armatum vincit inermis,
Agnus predonem, vitulus moriendo leonem.

Itis cuncus to observe the manner in which, during the middle
eges, rhyme sought to penetrate everywhere. 'l'hus we have
leonine sapphics as vell es leonine hexameters and pentameters.
The following belong probably to the lnh or l3th century, (Hom-
mey, Supplementnm Petrum, p. ivn) end are further curious as
being like the poem of Commodianus, see p. 12, to be scanned
by secent only end not by prosody:

nor do they very often resch the strength and precision which the

leonine sometimes attains, end I should say are inferior to it, at Ἴ ¹
least judging by the results severally producible in the tvo kinds; =

yet they too ere not incapsble os e certain terseness and even
elegante, of the same character as ve heve seen the leonine verses
to display. An exarnple or tvo may suffice. ln these lines Hil-
debert describes how the legal shadows ere outhnes of the truth,
but do yet disappear and fly away, Christ the substance being
