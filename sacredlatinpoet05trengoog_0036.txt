so to be gathered into nobler chalieeS, vessels more fit-
ted to contain it-new, even as that which was poured
into them was new.

We ean trace step by step the stmgglo between the
two principles of heathen and Christian life, which
were here opposed to one another. Ae the old classieal
Roman clement grew daily weaker in the new Ohris-

tian world which now had been founded3 as the novel
element of Christian life strengthened and gained

ground; as poetry became popular again, not the cul-
tivated entertainment of the polite and lettered few,
a gracelul ornament of the scholar and the gentleman,
but thatin which all men desired to express or to find
expreseed for them, their hopes and fears, their joys and
their sorrows, and all the immortal longings of their
common humanity ;-a confincment became less and less ’
endurable within the old and stereotypcd forms, which,

, having had for their own ends their own fitness and

heauty, were yet ordained for the expressiug ol far
other thoughts and leelings and sentimenta, than those
which now stirred at far deeper depths the spirits and
the hearts of men. The whole scheme on which the
Latin prosodical poetry was formed, was felt to he

about thirty words which no skill could introduce into the hexa-
meter οι pentameter: and it' to these were added those which only
by help ol elisione could find place, as tribrachs‚ cretica ending in
m, they would not amount to much less than a word a linc. Aa
the line contained in general sewer than eight words, it would be a
fair statement to say that from the chief metres in the Latin lan-

guage, one word out of every eight, which it might otlierwise be ·

desirable to use, is hy the rules ol its prosody excluded.
