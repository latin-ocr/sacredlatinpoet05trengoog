HILDEBERT.

ILDEBERT, born in losannensis the scholar os

Berengarius, iu all the highest culture of his age ;
and having himself taught theology for a while et Maus,
was in 1097 made bishop of that see‚and in 1126 became
arohbishop of Tours. A wisa aud gentle prelate, although
not wanting iu oourage to dare, and fortitude to endure,

There is an interesting sketoh of his character aud of his
work in the new edition of Nesnder’s Life of St Bernurd,
pp. 447-458.

His verses amount, as the Benedictiue editors calculata
to ten thousand or more. The enforced leisure of imprison-

composing so many. of these a great number cousist of
versifications of seriptural history, or of the legends of
saints, in heroic or elegiao' verse, sometimes thymiug
and sometimes not, and possess a very slight velue. More
eurious thau these is a legendary life of Mahomet, whereof
Ampere (t. 3, p. 440) has given a brief aualysis; and his
lines on the death of his master Berengarius display true
feeling, end a very deep affeeti0n3 however hard we may
