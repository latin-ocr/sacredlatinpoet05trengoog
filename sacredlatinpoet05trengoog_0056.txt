When therefore at a later day rhyme began to
enter aa a permanent element into, and to be accounted
almost a necessary condition of, poetical composition,
this was not the introduction of something wholly
strange or new· Rhyme, though new to Latin verse
in the extent to which it was now adopted, yet had
already made itself an occasional place even in the
later or prosodia poetry of Rome ; as no doubt it was,
and would have continued to be, of far more frequent
recurrence in that earlier national poetry, which, how-
ever, as we have seen, was supprest before it had
reached its full and natural developement.

But to return to the progressive steps by which
it unfolded itself there-this much having been said
to shew that it did not come in quite as a strange
thing, but as that rather of which the germs were

laid iu the versification already exirting, that it had
that “early anticipation,” which one has given as
among the sure marks of a true developement. And
here it would be a great mistake, and oue which all
the documenta that have come down to us would

po'e‘sa' Homeri, sometimes ascribed to Plutarch, adduces (c. 35) the
ὁμοιοτελευτον as one among the σχήματα of the Homerie poetry,
end very distinetly recognizes thecharm which rhyme has for the
ear3 for, having instaneed aa an example,

'Hor' ἔθνεα εἶσι μελισσάων α’διννίων
Πέτρης ἐκ γλαφυρῆς ἀεὶ νέον ἐρχομενάων,

he goes on to snyr Tul δὲ εἰρημένα, καὶ ‘rc‘ τοιαῦτα μάλιστα
προστίθησι τῷ λόγῳ χάριν καὶ ἡδονήν,
