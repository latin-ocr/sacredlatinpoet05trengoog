Of course, those who consider that the whole
middle age theology is to be ignored and placed
under ban—that nothing is to learned from it, or
nothing but barm-those 1 must expect to disap-
prove, not merely of a small matter or two in the
volume, but of it altogether; for the very idea of
the book rests on tbe supposition that it is worth
our while to know what the feelings of these ages
were—what the Church was doing during a thou-

sand years of her existence ;-on the assumption
also, that the voices in which men uttered then the
deepest things of their hearts, will be voices in

which we may also utter and embody the deepest
things of our own. For myself, I cannot but feel
that we are untrue to our position as a Church,
that is, as an hbtorio body, and above all to our
position as members of a Protestant Church, when
we thus wish to dissever, as far as we may, the
links of our historio connexion with the past. We
should better realize that position, if we looked at
those middle ages with the expectation, (which the
facts would abundantly justify,) of finding the two
Churches, which at the Reformation disengaged
themselves from one another, in the bosom of the
Church which was then—if we looked at those
ages, not seeking (as sometimes is done, I cannot

but feel most unfairly, in regard to earlier times) ’

to claim them as Protestant, but as little ςέειρηῒίης
