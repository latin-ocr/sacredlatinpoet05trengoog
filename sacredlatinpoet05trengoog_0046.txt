The process, in truth, was wonderfully like that
which found place, when, in the first half of the six-
teenth century, the rational poetry of Spain yielded to
the influence of Italian models‚ and Castillejo was
obliged to give place to Bosoan and Garcilasso. The
points oi resemblance in these parallel cases are many.
'llius in either case, the conquercd, and at that time,
morally, and so far as strength went, intellectually, far
inferior people,-the people, therefore, with much less,
as we may surely believe, of latent productivity for the
future, whatever may have been the marvels which
it had aeconrplished in the past,-imposed its literary
yoke on the conquering and the nobler nation; caused
it in a measure to be ashamed of what hitherto it
had effected, or of what, continuing in its own line,
it was likely to bring to pass. Nor was this the only
point in which the processes were similar. There were
other points of resemblance—as this, that it is impos-
sible to deny but that here, as there, poetry of a very
high order was composed upon the new models. Great
results came of the change, aud of the new direction in
which the national taste was turned. Every thing,
in short, came of it but the one thing, for the absence
of which all else is but an insufficient compensation3
namely, a thoroughly popular literature, which should
truly smack of the soil from which it sprung, which
should be the utteranoe of a nation’s own lile, and not
merely acoents, which, however sweet or musical, were
yet caught from the lips of another, and only artificially

fitted to its own.
