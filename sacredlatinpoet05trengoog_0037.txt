¹ The Instructiottes of Commodianus, a poem quite valuelers
itt a literary point of view, is yet curicus in this respects and the
more eurious now that it is placed by scholare in the latter half of
the third century rather than in the fourth, where it used to be set.
For very singular is it to find, more than an hundred years before
the last notes of the clasrieal muse hed expired in Claudian, a
poem of considerable length composed on the system ofa total
abandonment of quantity, end substitution of secent in its room-
maintaining the apparent frameworlt of the old classico] hexameter,
but‚lilling it up on a principle altogether new. Nor can we sup-

a system of versification which had become intolersbly artificial in
his time and for him; and to develop for himself, or finding deve-
loped to use, one in which he should in great part be released from
its arbitrary obligations. Iu the following lines, forming part ol
an hymn first published by N iehbuhr ( Rhein. Muscam, iosap. 7),
lines plainly intended to consist of four dactyles, each, dactylos,
